Note for modified ROM users: The app may or may not work depending on app's dependencies modified.
Tweaks that modify the device model number in the build prop (ro.product.vendor.model) will cause
bugs on the app including the license verification. Also, do not restore app from backup, always fresh install.

Info:
This app targets older android sdk in order to control refresh rates without ADB setup or root. Just
tap OK the dialog that says "This app was built for an older version of Android...." when opened for
the first time. If OK button is not visible, just tap the blank space on the lowest portion of the
dialog.
